Future version additions

0.0.2:

Add recent button functionality in the file menu. This button should open a cascade menu with recent open files and the user can open 
the listed recent files.

Add Multiplicative scatter correction as a preprocessing method only if demanded by users. Currently, MSC was removed
due to the computational load of it's calculation on large HSI iamges.
